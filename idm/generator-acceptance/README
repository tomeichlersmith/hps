Some Gen-Level iDM Acceptance Studies

I also used this workspace to figure out how to run the readout-recon-tuplize pipeline
so there is some clutter leftover from that.

I have since deleted the slcio and root files since they were taking up unnecessary
space on the export scratch disk. With all the important plots on Jira or in presentations
on indico, I may consider deleting this workspace after transitioning successfully to
a new one focused on a full reach calculation.
