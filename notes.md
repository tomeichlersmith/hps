# HPS General Notes

## March 16, 2022
Omar, Tim, Jeremy, Me

### Admin Details
What admin details need to be done to get started? i.e. Do I need to email folks? Has Tim gotten the go-ahead from the HPS collab?

- HPS has an Executive Committee (EC) which meets to decide on policy
- Meeting on Monday (March 14) between Tim and EC - different concerns that need to be addressed
- Dissertation analysis on HPS without direct supervisor on HPS precedent set by Omar
- Need a de facto supervisor that _is_ on HPS (Jon Jaros for Omar, Tim has taken on this responsibility for me)
- Bylaws require certain minimums for being a member
  - Performance of some kind of service work (explicit in bylaws)
  - Taking shifts (implicit) doesnt make sense now given HPS wont take data for awhile, EC agrees this wont be much of a problem
- Tim POV: obvious synergy between service and necessary tools for analysis
- More discussion in future about what service work would be necessary
  - Some may relate to analysis, some may be separate
- Process by which someone becomes a member
  - Supervisor applies for membership listing potential service tasks and potential thesis topic
- Jeremy can observe and provide feedback on my work? Not a problem (even with non-public data).
- Formally speaking, I am not listed as HPS student with DOE, so need to maintain a plausible 50% time maximum for work on HPS.
  - EC would like more focus on HPS during actual dissertation research.
- UCSC had money for ops on HPS but no research, so SLAC was paying for Omar via UCSC
  - PI (Alex ?Gridlow)and sub-PI named at UCSC
- Plan B is to actually try to get separate funding to avoid interference with DOE
  - either through folks on HPS at SLAC or through external/UMN fellowship (Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship - DDF) 

### Analysis Options
Which analysis should I focus on?

- Fewer options when focused on shorter/tighter analyses
- Four data sets (2 engineering 2015 and 2016, 2 physics 2019 and 2021)
  - Engineering are lower statistics
  - Physics are still in process of calibration (difficult)
- Analyses using newer data sets are more exciting for HPS but uncertain time scale
- 2016 data has some interesting reach for SIMPs and Inelastic DM (IDM)
  - Slightly different signature than dark photon in LDMX
  - Mediator in HPS decays back to SM leptons after taking most of the energy
  - Decay products make mass peak and displaced vertex
  - SIMPs and IDM create a dark state _as well_ as the visible decay products
    - more complex analysis
  - Minimal dark photon search on 2016 already done
  - 2016 well calibrated and understood, ready for developing new analysis
  - One student already working on SIMPs (Alex Bellman at UCSC)
  - I could work on IDM
- Workflow 
  - Understand model space with Philip and Natalia
  - Develop MadGraph cards for that model space
  - Put LHE files through detector sim
  - Understand acceptance of detector there
  - Look for selections that fit this space
  - No novel reconstruction needed
- Downside of 2016 Analysis
  - Service work with MC and analysis techniques
  - HPS need most help with calib/recon of newer data (Tracking fibers and Lead Tungstate crystals)
- Application for Membership to EC
  - My analysis is X
  - My service work is Y
  - EC discusses with advisor(s) and student to nail down details
- Any construction of priority list would be _very_ helpful
  - MC, Reco/Calib, and Analysis coordinators poking

### HPS SW Chat
Delayed for next time...
